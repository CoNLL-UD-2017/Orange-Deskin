# Orange-Deskin
CoNLL 2017 Shared Task Team Orange-Deskin (Orange/OLPS/CONTENT/DESKIN)

We use a modified version of BistParser (https://github.com/elikip/bist-parser), which
  * only outputs dependency trees with a unique root
  * uses pseudo projectivisation
  * can deal with conllu (comments, 2-3 and 5.1 lines)

Everything is trained exclusively on Universial Dependency Conll2017 treebanks.
Word embeddings have been calculated on corpora taken from https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11234/1-1989
